# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist clients Accountability Accounting with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio for their customers.

## Objectives
1)  Preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA.
2)  Reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.
3)  Create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Step 2.
4)  Visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components created in Step 2, then create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
